# PowerShellAsync
base class for async-enabled PowerShell Cmdlets.

When you build PowerShell Cmdlets, it is required that calls to WriteObject, WriteVerbose, WriteWarning, etc be originated from BeginProcessing/ProcessRecord/EndProcessing method on __the main thread__!.

With a general move towards async code, it's become hard to use newer libraries inside the traditional PowerShell Cmdlets. Up until now :)

With 3 easy steps you can take advantage of the async programming:
 
1. Install PowerShellAsync from nuget.org
  * ``PM> Install-Package PowerShellAsync``


2. Replace base class of your Cmdlet from _PSCmdlet_ to _AsyncCmdlet_
  * ``[Cmdlet("Test", "SomethingCool")]
      public class TestSomethingCool : AsyncCmdlet``


3. Replace BeginProcessing/ProcessRecord/EndProcessing methods with their xxxAsync counterparts
  * ``protected override async Task ProcessRecordAsync()``


4. Enjoy!!!
